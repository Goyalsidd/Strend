As part of our project Strend this year, we have done the following: / We collected about 100 drafters from senior batches for Rs 100 each, and sold them to the freshman year for Rs 140 each, saving them from having to pay Rs 750 for a drafter that they would only use for a semester; / We collected 50 lab coats from senior batches for Rs 150 each, and sold them to the freshman year for Rs 250 each.We organized a collecting drive while the 2020 batch was leaving, and we were able to gather about 330 garments from the different hostels. We plan to sell some of these things and donate the remainder when the rest of the crew gets back from summer break. Additionally, we gathered about forty mattresses from the 2019 batch, of which we gave seventeen to the freshmen class and the remaining thirty to a local vendor so that their stuffings could be recycled.We are now creating laundry bag prototypes out of flexes that were left over from different events around the college. These bags are waterproof and can store more than 10 kg. We have given 27 laundry bags to college employees who live nearby.



This has enabled us to accomplish the following:



By acquiring equipment from senior batches and lending it to freshmen year, we have established an ecosystem within the college whereby students who need it only for a semester or two can rent it, with a portion going toward covering any wear and tear or damage sustained during use. The equipment we rent out must be returned to us at the end of the semester by the corresponding batch. We made a profit of Rs. 10,000 in the process, all the while making sure that students didn't overpay for lab coats and drafters, which cost Rs. 350 each.Recycling helps the underprivileged in our society, such as first-year students from low-income families and the workers who live close to the institution, while lowering carbon emissions and moving toward a sustainable future for all of us.
